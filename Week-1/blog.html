                <h2>Understanding Dog Behavior</h2>
                <p>Understanding dog behavior is crucial for training and building a strong relationship with your pet. Dogs communicate through body language, vocalizations, and behavior patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Body Language</h3>

                    <p>
                        Dogs communicate primarily through body language. Tail movement,
                        ear position, posture, and eye contact all send signals.<br> By observing
                        these cues, humans can better understand a dog's emotions and intentions,
                        which strengthens trust and safety.

                        <p>
                            A wagging tail does not always mean a dog is happy.
                            The speed and height of the wag matter.
